# IRQ Detection Example   
Use IRQ to detect transmission completion and reception completion.   

# About the nrf24l01 assertion

nrf24l01 has three assertions.   
- MAX_RT   
- RX_DR   
- TX_DS

After the packet is transmitted by the PTX and received by the PRX the ACK packet with payload is transmitted from the PRX to the PTX.   
The RX_DR IRQ is asserted after the packet is received by the PRX, whereas on the PTX side the TX_DS IRQ is asserted when the ACK packet is received by the PTX.   
On the PRX side, the TX_DS IRQ for the ACK packet payload is asserted after a new packet from PTX is received.

the ACK packet is lost and a retransmission is needed before the TX_DS IRQ is asserted, but the RX_DR IRQ is asserted immediately.   
MAX_RT IRQ is asserted if the auto retransmit counter(ARC_CNT) exceeds the programmed maximum limit(ARC).   
See the nrf24l01 datasheet for more details.   

In this project, RX_DX and MAX_RT are enabled, and TX_DS is disabled.   
RX_DX is asserted when reception is complete.   
No signal is asserted when transmission is complete.   
MAX_RT is asserted when transmission fails.   
Therefore, if there is no assertion after the transmission, the transmission succeeds, and if there is an assertion, the transmission fails.   
If TX_DS is enabled, the assertion occurs whether the transmission was successful or unsuccessful, and you must again check the register to distinguish between the two.
